    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest planet in the solar system in terms of size and mass. Its near-surface environments are the only places in the universe known to harbour life. Earth is located in the Orion-Cygnus Arm, one of the four spiral arms of the Milky Way, which lies about two-thirds of the way from the centre of the Galaxy.</p>

        <li>The length of Earth's day is increasing. When Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago, its day would have been roughly six hours long. </li>
        <li>
            Earth has never been perfectly round. The planet bulges around the equator by an extra 0.3 percent as a result of the fact that it rotates about its axis.</li>
        <li>If Earth were a perfect sphere, its gravitational field would be the same everywhere.</li>
